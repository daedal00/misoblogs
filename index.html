            <h2>August 1, 2023</h2>
            <p>“I, for one, was skeptical if God was even listening to my prayers and searched for other “worldly” possible ways to overcome my problems. That was until I felt like I had nothing and no one else I could turn to other than Him. Through earnest prayers and the realization of servitude, I feel like things slowly started to get better. I believe that with faith, prayer, and living for His purpose, God will provide when He seems the time to be right. Although even now those problems haven’t been completely overcome, I trust that He is watching over me.”</p>
            <p>“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 4:6-7</p>

            <p>God calms your fears not by removing the problems, but by revealing his diving power and presence. Your anxiety decreases as your understanding of God increases. His hands are open so place yourself entirely in his care.</p> <p>"Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand." Proverbs 19:21</p>
