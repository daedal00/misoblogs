                <p>You may be feeling underprepared or overwhelmed at this moment, but our source of strength is unparalleled. Our resilience when rooted in Christ is beyond fathoming. Today’s qt verse is written by the Apostle Paul who’s faced numerous trials, yet he wrote this verse as a declaration of faith. The mcat can be a declaration of faith for you too. Your ability to succeed isn’t limited by your personal capacity but is magnified by His strength working through you. No challenge is too great when we’re fortified by God’s strength. Believe in yourself as He believes in you:) Hwaiting!</p>

                <p>When life presents you with a challenge, there are times when fear tries to grip your heart. Yet we should remain strong and courageous, not through our efforts or someone else’s, but through God’s presence. He is next to you now, before, and will forever always be. He is guiding and comforting you in every step. Trust in His presence and be confident.</p>
                <p>"Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go." Joshua 1:9</p>
                <p>You got this, I believe in you and you did an amazing job even getting here too. Very proud of you :></p>

                <p>When we entrust our paths to Him, we aren’t giving up control but rather going hand in hand with the Almighty. Even preparing for an exam can be an act of worship. Dedicating the hard work, study hours, and even anxieties to Him. In doing so, we are not only seeking His blessing but acknowledging His sovereignty over every aspect of our lives. We can rest in the assurance that when we commit our ways to Him, He will act in our favor. He moves in ways that go beyond our understanding, we should entrust the outcome to Him, and know that He will act for our good.</p>
                <p>"Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him, and he will act." Psalm 37:5</p>

                <p>I know I have tried to rely on my understanding and knowledge and often feel lost because of that. For you now, you may feel lost in your efforts, maybe even doubting if this is the right path. Although preparation is essential, it should be coupled with trust in God’s direction. Acknowledging Him and letting Him be the compass guiding you, ensuring you’re not only prepared, but aligned with His perfect will. We should balance our efforts with trust in God, surrendering our worries and trusting that God will guide our journey as His path for us is well-planned and astounding.</p>
                <p>"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths." Proverbs 3:5-6</p>

            <p>To bear our cross and follow Jesus means we have to die ourselves and live to Christ. We must lose our own life and walk forward in His. Our values, goals, loves, and activities can and must paint the picture of a people who enduringly serve God’s kingdom, not the present world order. When we trust in Christ we are crucified with Him, it is no longer we who live but Christ who lives in us. We should take up our cross daily and crucify our sinful passions and desires each and every day.</p>
            <p>“And he said to all, ‘If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself?’” Luke 9:23-25</p>
