            <h2>August 3, 2023</h2>
            <p>Amidst all the troubles and tribulations of this world, we need to remember that God has promised to be with us in the midst of those troubles. His very name <i>Immanuel</i> means “God with us.” We don’t have to be anxious alone, present it to God and ask for help and he will help. Through the difficulties, disappointments, pressures, and failures He will never leave us. We can find peace in that as he has already overcome the world, Jesus is with us and is already victorious. We can face and overcome the challenges with God, but since He's already victorious, what do we have to fear?</p>
            <p>“I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.” John 16:33</p>

            <p>“If our ultimate allegiance is not to the Lord Jesus, we are not really His Disciples,” I recall in a previous sermon Pastor Kevin talked about how in everything we do, whether it be studying, playing, or working that we do it for God. I didn’t understand what he meant by this since studying and working seem to be purely secular activities. As time went on, my interpretation of his message shifted with the realization of our ultimate purpose being to serve and glorify Him. We shouldn’t be overly anxious or tied down by academic achievements, it’s not about good grades or meeting the expectations of others. Instead, it’s using the gifts He’s given us and developing them to prepare ourselves for the work He has planned for us. God has a purpose for each of us and although we may never fully understand his plans for us, we can trust that He is guiding us. As students, our studies can be seen as an opportunity to serve God and grow and prepare us for the future so that we may be used by Him.</p>
            <p>“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.” Colossians 3:23-24</p>

            <h2>August 1, 2023</h2>
            <p>I, for one, was skeptical if God was even listening to my prayers and searched for other “worldly” possible ways to overcome my problems. That was until I felt like I had nothing and no one else I could turn to other than Him. Through earnest prayers and the realization of servitude, I feel like things slowly started to get better. I believe that with faith, prayer, and living for His purpose, God will provide when He seems the time to be right. Although even now those problems haven’t been completely overcome, I trust that He is watching over me.</p>
            <p>“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 4:6-7</p>

            <p>God calms your fears not by removing the problems, but by revealing his diving power and presence. Your anxiety decreases as your understanding of God increases. His hands are open so place yourself entirely in his care.</p> <p>"Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand." Proverbs 19:21</p>
