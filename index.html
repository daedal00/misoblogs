            <h2>August 9, 2023</h2>
            <p>Worry is an internal turmoil, a self-inflicted torment marked by relentless anxieties and cares. When we worry, we cast a shadow over our minds, allowing fears, stresses, and potential problems to dominate our thoughts. We often become consumed by hypothetical situations that may never occur. Worry can be seen like a fire, the more we feed it with our anxious thoughts, the larger and more consuming it becomes. It not only exhausts our minds but also affects our body, causing strain and distress. However, we can transcend this cycle of worry, not alone but with God. With the prayer of petition we can lift our worries onto Him. By entrusting our anxieties to God and truly believing in His sovereignty, we embrace the reality that He is in control.
            </p>
            <p>“Anxiety in a man’s heart weights him down, but a good word makes him glad. '' Proverbs 12:25</p>

            <p>I often wondered what the point of prayer was if God is all-knowing and knows our requests before we even present them to Him. But prayer is actually for our benefit. It allows us to act in faith on what we know about God’s character. When we pray for the particulars of our problems and see how God responds, our faith grows. We come to trust that God will always be there for us, even in the midst of our most anxious moments. Prayer is simply a conversation with our heavenly Father where we place our anxieties and worries into His hands. We are reminding ourselves of the promises He has made in his Word. There are fewer anxious thoughts and more prayer-filled thoughts.</p>

            <h2>August 7, 2023</h2>
            <p>The realization that I didn’t <i><strong>need</strong></i> to turn to other things other than God was the outcome of desperately searching for Him and His love. It’s a process of examining the needs in my heart that I have tried to fill in my own way, and understanding that there are spiritual needs that can only be met by God. Once we experience the satisfaction of our spiritual needs fulfilled by God, we can enjoy the physical blessing He gives us too.</p>
            <p>“Jesus said to her, ‘Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I will give him will becoming in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.’” John 4:13-14</p>

            <h2>August 6, 2023</h2>
            <p>I want to know how to go to the Lord for everything I need. I want to know how to be strong in the Lord; grounded in the knowledge of His love. Healthy alone and healthy in community. There is something profound that comes from the experience of knowing the Lord in moments of desperation when there was no one else but Him. Experiencing the truth of Him never leaving you nor forsaking you, to experience His love. We want to be deeply rooted in a steadfast relationship with Him and have it embedded within us to know of His goodness and faithfulness and ever-present help in times of need. Instead of building a relationship with whatever distraction/escape is used in unpleasant times, we will learn to build a relationship with Him. “When there was no one else - that is where You showed me You are <i>enough</i>.” Sometimes rather than hearing from others that God is always with us, we have to experience it first to know.</p>
            <p>"For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence, for my hope is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation, my fortress; I shall not be shaken. On God rests my salvation and my glory; my mighty rock, my refuge is God. Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him; God is a refuge for us." Psalm 62:5-8</p>

            <h2>August 5, 2023</h2>
            <p>Setting the Lord before us is a conscious decision we have to make. Not only acknowledging his existence but focusing on His guidance and making Him the priority in every situation. We should recognize his sovereignty and submit to His will in all areas of our life. We know that He is always with us, that He is all-powerful, and so ever-loving. Although we will never be free from difficulties, in confidence we can know that God has promised to always be with us and He can withstand any challenge that comes His way. We can endure the ups and downs of life by recognizing His constant presence in our lives and know that we will never be shaken since we are not alone. We have the strength and protection of the Almighty God on our side.</p>
            <p>"I have set the Lord always before me; because he is at my right hand, I shall not be shaken." Psalm 16:8</p>

            <h2>August 4, 2023</h2>
            <p>Throughout my life, I know for a fact I have been swayed constantly by worldly values and lost sight of God countless times. I forget that these materialistic values cannot provide the same true fulfillment and eternal peace that only God can provide. I am often reminded of this with hardships of which I turn back to him for help and realize that once again He is the alpha and omega and purpose of my life. Our decisions and values should not be dictated by money or other worldly values, flooding and distracting our thoughts and pulling us away from the path God has set for us. Instead, our focus should be entirely on serving God, trusting in His provisions, and using what He’s blessed us with for Him and to bless others. We must constantly examine our hearts and priorities, especially in a world where temptation is always tackling us from all sides.</p>
            <p>“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.” Matthew 6:24</p>

            <h2>August 3, 2023</h2>
            <p>Amidst all the troubles and tribulations of this world, we need to remember that God has promised to be with us in the midst of those troubles. His very name <i>Immanuel</i> means “God with us.” We don’t have to be anxious alone, present it to God and ask for help and he will help. Through the difficulties, disappointments, pressures, and failures He will never leave us. We can find peace in that as he has already overcome the world, Jesus is with us and is already victorious. We can face and overcome the challenges with God, but since He's already victorious, what do we have to fear?</p>
            <p>“I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.” John 16:33</p>

            <p>“If our ultimate allegiance is not to the Lord Jesus, we are not really His Disciples,” I recall in a previous sermon Pastor Kevin talked about how in everything we do, whether it be studying, playing, or working that we do it for God. I didn’t understand what he meant by this since studying and working seem to be purely secular activities. As time went on, my interpretation of his message shifted with the realization of our ultimate purpose being to serve and glorify Him. We shouldn’t be overly anxious or tied down by academic achievements, it’s not about good grades or meeting the expectations of others. Instead, it’s using the gifts He’s given us and developing them to prepare ourselves for the work He has planned for us. God has a purpose for each of us and although we may never fully understand his plans for us, we can trust that He is guiding us. As students, our studies can be seen as an opportunity to serve God and grow and prepare us for the future so that we may be used by Him.</p>
            <p>“Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.” Colossians 3:23-24</p>

            <h2>August 1, 2023</h2>
            <p>I, for one, was skeptical if God was even listening to my prayers and searched for other “worldly” possible ways to overcome my problems. That was until I felt like I had nothing and no one else I could turn to other than Him. Through earnest prayers and the realization of servitude, I feel like things slowly started to get better. I believe that with faith, prayer, and living for His purpose, God will provide when He seems the time to be right. Although even now those problems haven’t been completely overcome, I trust that He is watching over me.</p>
            <p>“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” Philippians 4:6-7</p>

            <p>God calms your fears not by removing the problems, but by revealing his diving power and presence. Your anxiety decreases as your understanding of God increases. His hands are open so place yourself entirely in his care.</p> <p>"Many are the plans in the mind of a man, but it is the purpose of the Lord that will stand." Proverbs 19:21</p>
